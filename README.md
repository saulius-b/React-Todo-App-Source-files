Will update soon, to have clearer, better written code.

This is a TODO app, with Crud functionality (create new todo, read existing todos, delete todos, update todos by marking them complete). The data is saved on google Firebase SDK Firestore, used as a back end solution. 
Here is the link to the deployed app - https://saulius-b.github.io/React-crud-deployed/
